Muggles is a 1 year old female Jack Russell terrier mix. She is shy and loving but small children make her nervous. 
She enjoys naps on couches and time at the dog park. She was born with a cogenital heart condition so she requires
a little bit of extra attention. She gives big cuddles in return.
